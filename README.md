# Motorbike Simulation Project

This project simulates the performance of a motorbike under various conditions using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), aerodynamics, thermal analysis, and structural analysis. The project is written in C, with preprocessing and postprocessing handled by Python scripts.

## Features

- **Aerodynamics Simulation**: Calculates dynamic drag coefficient, rolling resistance, and wind effects on the motorbike.
- **Thermal Analysis**: Models heat transfer on the motorbike's components.
- **Fluid Dynamics**: Includes advanced turbulence modeling, fluid flow solvers, and particle tracking.
- **Structural Analysis**: Performs stress and strain analysis on the motorbike's frame and components.
- **Preprocessing and Postprocessing**: Python scripts to prepare inputs and visualize simulation results.
